### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pet_adoption_app.git
   cd pet_adoption_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up API keys**
   - Copy `lib/core/api/api_keys.example.dart` to `lib/core/api/api_keys.dart`
   - Add your actual API keys from The Cat API and The Dog API

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Style Guide

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Flutter/Dart Specific

- Follow the official [Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Prefer `final` over `var` when the variable won't be reassigned
- Use trailing commas for better formatting
- Group imports: dart, flutter, packages, relative

### Architecture Guidelines

This project follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, repository interfaces, and use cases
- **Data Layer**: Contains repository implementations, data sources, and models
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components, BLoC, and screens

When adding new features:
- Start with the domain layer (entities, repositories, use cases)
- Implement the data layer (models, data sources, repository implementations)
- Finally, implement the presentation layer (UI, BLoC)

## Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for user flows
- Aim for good test coverage but focus on critical paths

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add inline documentation for complex logic
- Update API documentation if you change interfaces

Thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰
